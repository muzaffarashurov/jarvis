## v0.1.0-ep022

Released: 2026-07-31

### Added

- RAG Engine (src/core/rag/rag_engine.py)
- RAG Manager (src/core/rag/rag_manager.py)
- RagProviderInfo / RagContextItem / RagResult domain models
- RAG Service
- RAG Module
- CLI integration: rag help / status / query / context / provider / use
- EP-022 test suite (tests/EP022/test_rag_engine.py)

### Changed

- src/bootstrap.py: wires RagManager/RagService/RagModule into the command
  router, mirroring the Embedding Engine's degrade-gracefully-on-invalid-config
  pattern
- config/config.yaml: added a 'rag' configuration section (enabled, top_k,
  max_context_characters)
- src/modules/test_module.py: registers the EP-022 test suite so 'test EP022'
  and 'test all' pick it up

### Improved

- Retrieval (EP-020) and embedding (EP-021) are now composed into a single,
  reusable context-generation pipeline consumable by future EPs

### Fixed

-

### Compatibility

Backward compatible with EP-019, EP-020 and EP-021. Does not modify the
Project Index Engine, the Retrieval Engine, or the Embedding Engine. The RAG
Engine calls no AI provider and performs no chat completion.
